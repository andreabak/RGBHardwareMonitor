_RGBHardwareMonitor_ is an utility that allows displaying RGB lights effects based on your computer hardware temperatures or other sensor data.
It relies on _OpenHardwareMonitor_ to query sensors values or other hardware monitoring information, then sends this information to an _Arduino_ connected via USB, which in turn displays light effects on connected RGB led strips.

### DISCLAIMER
This project is currently in alpha stage. Structure, specifications and code can radically change at any time.

## Prerequisites

 - **[OpenHardwareMonitor](http://openhardwaremonitor.org/)**
   Needs to be either extracted/installed to a permanent location or already running.
 - **Arduino**
   An Arduino UNO (or other compatible microcontroller with same or better specs) is needed to interface to the RGB led strips, using the included sketch
 - **RGB light strips or fans**
   Connected to the arduino

## Installation

Download the ![latest release](/releases/latest) from the |[release](/releases) section of this GitHub repo.
Pre-built binary releases are available in both installable or portable versions.

Only Windows operating system is currently supported.

## Configuration

The configuration file _config.ini_ can be found in the program's folder (default _%ProgramFiles%\RGBHardwareMonitor_). These are the main variables that can be specified:
 - `[RGBHardwareMonitor]` section:
   - `openhardwaremonitor_path`: defines the executable path of OpenHardwareMonitor, used to auto-start OHW if it's not running already
   - `arduino_serial_id`: defines the USB serial ID of the arduino (_VID:PID_), used to identify the serial port for the arduino connection
   - `log_file`: specifies a log file for debugging/logging purposes
   - `log_level`: specifies the verbosity level for the logging output (accepted values: `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`)
   - `verbosity`: specifies the verbosity level for console output (this option has no effect when using the pre-built binaries as the terminal window is hidden by default)
 - `[RingLight#]` section(s):
   These section(s) define the various _RingLights_ effects, currently the only supported. Multiple RingLights are supported by the arduino code, and can be specified using an unique index for each (eg. `[RingLight1`, `[RingLight2]`, ...). They should conceptually identify a single hardware component for which to display temperature, load and fan speed.
   - `name`: a human-readable name for the related hardware component (eg. `CPU` or `GPU`)
 - `[RingLight#.{Type}Sensor]` subsections:
   These "subsections" are used to specify the sensors data source and value ranges for _temperature_, _load_, and _fan_ for the _RingLight_ (respectively: `[RingLight#.TempSensor]`, `[RingLight#.LoadSensor]`, `[RingLight#.FanSensor]`)
   - `device`: the device (from OpenHardwareMonitor) providing the sensors (accepted values: `mainboard`, `superio`, `cpu`, `ram`, `hdd`, `gpu`)
   - `filter_{type}`: one or more filters are used to select the correct sensor for the device from OpenHardwareMonitor. The available filters are `filter_name`, `filter_identifier`, `filter_sensor_type`. The available values for the filters can be obtained by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting "Show hardware info".
   - `range_min` and `range_max`: the "raw" values from the sensor that will be mapped to min (=0) and max (=100). Can be used to trigger some light effects only above certain thresholds (eg. temperature, cool at `range_min: 30.0`, hot at `range_max: 70.0`)
   
The default config file included should be edited to accomodate your custom setup before running the program for the first time.

## Arduino setup

The arduino code can be found in the arduino/rgb_temps folder inside the program folder.

## Usage

Just run from the start menu (install version) or RGBHardwareMonitor.exe from the program folder (portable version).

The program runs from the taskbar tray and right-clicking the icon displays a menu with options.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

<!--Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.-->
